# Running
To run this application use `./gradlew jfxRun`.

# Install prerequisites
First, make sure you have JavaFX installed. I use OpenJDK on Ubuntu. OpenJDK 
ships with Ubuntu 16.04, but despite JavaFX being a part of the JRE, it doesn't 
ship with the standard OpenJDK package. Instead you should run:

```
sudo apt-get install openjfx
```

This will add JARs to `/usr/lib/jvm/<JAVA VERSION>/lib`.

## IntelliJ IDEA
I was using IntelliJ IDEA to develop and I discovered I had to do some 
additional steps to notice I had installed JavaFX:

1. In the newly created project, go to File â†’ Project Structure
1. Remove the JDK and recreate it, to make sure the classpath includes the new JavaFX jars
1. Make sure the module is targeting Java 8
2. 
You may not have to do these steps - I created the project before installing 
JavaFX, which may have been the root of my problems.
